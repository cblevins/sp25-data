title: Self Assessments
---

You will be writing three self assessments in this class, due in Week 5, ~~Week 10~~ Week 11, and Finals Week. The first two self assessments are short, 2-3 paragraphs submitted via email as a Word document to Professor Blevins. They should convey to me: a) the areas of the class in which you've been doing well along with examples of how you've been excelling, b) the areas of the class in which you could be doing better, and c) what your learning goals are for the remainder of the semester. For Self-Assessment #2, please include in part c) a concrete idea/proposal for your final project. 

The final self assessment is a longer, 2-3 page reflection on the semester that expands on what you accomplished (along with concrete examples), any areas in which you struggled or wish you had done better, how you want to apply what you've learned in this class to your studies or career moving forward, and the overall grade that you feel you deserve for the class. You need to submit your final assessment as a Word document to me by Wednesday, May 12th.
