- Open GitHub Desktop and select your course repository
- Click `Fetch origin` to check for any changes
- Go to Branch ‚Üí `Merge into current branch` ‚Üí select `upstream/main` and click `Create a merge commit` if there are updates
- Click `Pull origin` if it's available (if not, you're up to date!)
- Click `Push origin` to sync everything up

## Part 1: Jupyter Notebooks

- Open Anaconda Navigator
- Open Jupyter Labs
- Within Jupyter Labs, navigate to your local copy of your GitHub repository inside `working-with-data` folder - ie. `blevins-sp25-data-material`
- Look inside `week-02` and make sure you have the following files:
  - `jupyter-notebooks-intro.ipynb`
  - `python-variables.ipynb`
- Double-click `jupyter-notebooks-intro.ipynb` to open it
- Follow along with your instructor as you work through the notebook

## Part 2: Python

- You should see "Changes (some number)" on the left side, with a list of files that have been changed or added
- At the bottom left of GitHub Desktop, write a brief "Summary" of what you did (ex. "Added practice notes file")
- Click "Commit to main"
- Click "Push origin" to sync these changes to your GitHub fork
