title: Installing Python
---

## Overview

In order to start coding with Python we need to do some back-end set-up. There lot of different ways to write and run Python code. In this class we are primarily going to be using a piece of software called Anaconda, which will install Python behind the scenes and also allow you to access hundreds of pre-installed Python "packages" - or collections of Python code people have written to do common tasks.

## Windows Instructions

- Go to the Anaconda download website ([link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/))
- Click `Skip registration`
- Click the download link under Windows
- Find the installer file you just downloaded (try `Downloads` folder) and double-click to launch the installation
- From the website: "If you encounter issues during installation, temporarily disable your anti-virus software during install, then re-enable it after the installation concludes."
- Click through the License Agreement
- Select `Just me` for installation option
- Leave the default destination folder (it should be something like `C:\Users\<your-username>\Anaconda3\`)
  - Note: if your Windows username has spaces, choose a different destination folder (like `C:\anaconda`)
- Leave the default options checked:

## Mac Instructions

- Go to the Anaconda download website ([link](https://www.anaconda.com/download/))
- Click `Skip registration`
- [Follow these instructions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943) to see what kind of Mac you have (Apple Silicon or Intel). On your computer, go to the Apple icon () in the upper left hand corner -> About this Mac to find out.
- Click the down arrow on the Download for Mac button and choose either the option for Apple Silicon or Intel, depending on your computer.
- Double Click the downloaded file
- Click through the various installation options, making `Install for all users of this computer` until it is installed.

## Open Anaconda Navigator

The installation process actually installed an application called `Anaconda Navigator`. Check to make sure this is installed and you can open it:

- Windows: From the Start menu, search for “Anaconda Navigator” and click to open.
- Mac: Open Launchpad, then click the Anaconda-Navigator icon (or search for it using Spotlight)
