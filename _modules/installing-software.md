title: Installing Software
---

## Overview

To get to the fun/useful parts of this class, you're going to need to go through the slog of installing several different kinds of software. This can often be surprisingly challenging - don't get discouraged and remember that you can always ask for help!

## Part 1: Github

We'll be using Github as one of our main pieces of infrastructure for this course (we'll be talking more about the details of why we're doing so and how it works later). To get started, you'll need to complete the following:

### Sign up for a Github Account

The first step is to sign up for a Github account. Before you do so, make sure to read the following:

- Choose a username that is relatively **short** and **professional**. This is going to be a public-facing account for you to showcase your work, so a safe assumption is that a future employer might be looking at it one day. You are also going to be building a personal website with a URL that is based on that username (`yourusername.github.io`), so you don't want something long or incomprehensible. For reference, Prof. Blevins's Github username is: `cblevins` and his personal website is `cblevins.github.io`.
- Use your **university email** (ending in @ucdenver.edu) to sign up for an account - this will allow you to get an education pack later in the semester.
- ⚠️ Write down your username and password somewhere safe!!! ⚠️

### Install Github Desktop

Follow the first **4:15 minutes** of the following tutorial to download and install Github Desktop and get it configured.

If you run into issues or need more detailed instructions:

- [Installing Github Desktop guide](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop)
- [Authenticating to GitHub in GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/authenticating-to-github-in-github-desktop)
- Note: If you run into issues when you are trying to change the Settings -> Git
  you might need to install a separate application called Git that will operate in the background (some of your machines might already have it installed). To install it, [follow these instructions](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git).

## Part 2: Python

The main programming language we will be using is Python. However, to use this language we'll first need to install some software. The main piece of software is called Anaconda. Install Anaconda on your computer (instructions for [Mac](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-mac-os-x), [Windows](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/installing-anaconda-windows), or [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/))
