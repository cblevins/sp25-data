---

Today we're going to look at The Transatlantic Slave Trade Database, a watershed digital project focused on the history of slavery and one that has been referenced in your readings for this class: <https://slavevoyages.org/>.

### Step 1: (A Truncated) Data Biography

As a group, let's try and hammer out a few of the questions that you'll be answering for your [Data Biography]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/data-biography) of a separate dataset. Go to <https://slavevoyages.org/> and try to figure out answers to the following questions about the dataset:

- **Where** did it come from? 
- **Who** collected, processed, and made it available?
- **How** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **Why** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **How** is it stored today? How did you access it?

### Step 2: Exploring the Database

Spend some time exploring the database itself (<https://slavevoyages.org/voyage/database>). See if you can use its functions to answer the following questions:

- Which nation sailed the most voyages in the 18th century?
- In which year did the largest number of enslaved people arrive in Barbados? 
- In what sub-region in Africa were the most enslaved people purchased?
