title: Markdown Practice
---

First create a new folder within your class folder `working-with-data` called `markdown-practice`. Launch Jupyter Labs and create a new Jupyter Notebook in that folder with the filename: `markdown-practice.ipynb`.

1. Use Markdown cells and headers to make an outline of your final project notebook following the [different parts outlined on the assignment page](https://cblevins.github.io/f21-data/assignments/research-project/#:~:text=by%2011%3A59PM-,research%20project%3A%20draft,-Your%20full%20research).
2. Insert a new markdown cell and figure out how to insert [this photo]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/racoon.jpeg).
3. Figure out how to resize and center the photo (hint: use the Google!).
