title: Data Biography
---

## Overview

In this assignment, you will write a "data biography" (I borrow this term from [Heather Krause](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/)) in which you investigate both the origins and contents of a historical dataset that I have selected for you. Your data biography should tell a story about the dataset in roughly 1,000 words that addresses the following questions:

- **What** kind of data is it? What information does it contain?
- **Who** collected, processed, and made it available?
- **Where** and **when** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **How** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **Why** was it collected, processed, and made available?
- **How** is it stored today? How did you access it?
- **What** are the major limitations of the dataset? Are there weaknesses, missing information, or any other larger social, cultural, or political context a user should keep in mind while using the dataset?

## Goals

- Understand the historical, social, and cultural contexts of data production
- Develop your skills in exploring datasets with Python
- Practice how to effectively write and communicate about data

## Requirements

- Conpleted in Jupyter Notebook file and rendered as a page on your Github Pages portfolio site.
- Uses Markdown cells for written analysis
- Inserts Python code cells between Markdown cells to open the dataset and illustrate some of its contents for the reader.
- Incorporates visual images (screenshot, photograph, etc.) into your written analysis.

## Instructions

### The Dataset

[This is the dataset](tbd) you will be examining. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the data and its history. Make sure that you download the actual dataset and take a look at its contents in addition to tracking down its history.

### Format

You will be completing this assigmnment in two steps. In Step 1, you will write your data biography in a Jupyter Notebook file. This will allow you to weave together your written analysis in Markdown cells along with using Python code cells and images that help show the contents of the data for your reader. In Step 2, you will render your data biography as a page on your Github Pages portfolio site.

Follow [these instructions](jupyter-notebook-github-pages) for more details on how to complete these two steps.

### Tips

- Don't assume your reader has any existing knowledge about the dataset. You'll need to offer an introduction and overview before diving into details.
- Note that, like most historical datasets, answering some of the main questions about your dataset will require you to think about the multiple stages through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So "Who collected it?" needs to include both the original historical actors who created the information along with the subsequent people who ultimately made it available for you.
- Think back to some of your readings from _Data Feminism_ for inspiration when considering the limitations of the dataset.

### Submission

Submit a link to your data biography page on your Github Pages site on [the Canvas assignment page](https://ucdenver.instructure.com/courses/552717/assignments/1921957).
