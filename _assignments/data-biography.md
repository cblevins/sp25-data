title: Data Biography
---

## Overview

In this assignment, you will write a "data biography" (I borrow this term from [Heather Krause](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/)) in which you investigate both the origins and contents of a historical dataset that I have selected for you. Your data biography will conduct a close analysis of the dataset and how it was produced in roughly **1,000 words**.

## Goals

- Understand the historical, social, and cultural contexts of data creation
- Develop skills in exploring tabular datasets in Python
- Practice how to effectively write and communicate about data

## Technical Requirements

- Written in a Jupyter Notebook file
- Uses Markdown cells for written analysis (approximately 1,000 words)
- Uses Python code cells to open the dataset and illustrate some of its contents for the reader
- Incorporates visual images (screenshot, photograph, etc.) into your written analysis
- Final version rendered as a page on your Github Pages portfolio site

## Instructions

### The Dataset

[This is the dataset](tbd) you will be examining. I am not providing you with any additional information about the dataset beyond the above link. You will need to put on your detective hats and try to familiarize yourself with the dataset and its history.

### Analyis and Writing

- Take as many notes as you can to answer the following questions about the dataset:
  - **Who** collected, processed, and made this information available?
  - **Where** and **when** was this information collected, processed, and made available?
  - **How** was this information collected, processed, and made available?
  - **Why** was this information collected, processed, and made available?
  - **How** is this data stored today? How did you access it?
  - **What** kind of data is it? What information does it contain?
  - **What** are the limitations or weaknesses of the dataset? What is missing?
  - **What** social, cultural, or political contexts should a user keep in mind while using the dataset?
- Look over your notes and come up with an outline for your data biography. It needs to include a mix of written analysis, Python code cells that explore the contents of the data, and visual images illustrating some of your points.
- You will write your data biography in a Jupyter Notebook file. This will allow you to weave together your written analysis inside Markdown cells along with using Python code cells and images.
- Once your assignment is finalized and ready for submission, you will then create a second version of the file that renders your notebook as a page on your Github Pages portfolio site.

⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ Follow [these instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/jupyter-notebook-github-pages) when you are ready to start writing. This will teach you how do things like insert images into your Jupyter Notebook file and render it as a page on Github Pages.

### Tips

- Don't assume your reader has any existing knowledge about the dataset. You'll need to offer an introduction and overview of the dataset before diving into more detail.
- You will need to address the **multiple stages** through which this information has passed to get to its current state as machine-readable data. So, for example: in answering the question "Who collected, processed, and made it available?" you need to include _both_ the original historical actors who collected the information _and_ the subsequent people who turned that information into a computational dataset.
- Review your readings from _Data Feminism_ for inspiration, including concepts like:
  - Raw vs. cooked data
  - All knowledge is situated
  - What gets counted counts
  - Rethink binaries and heirarchies

### Submission

Make **two submission**s on [the Canvas assignment page](https://ucdenver.instructure.com/courses/552717/assignments/1921957):

1. Website URL: a link to your data biography's page on your Github Pages site
2. File upload: Upload your original Jupyter Notebook `.ipynb` file.
