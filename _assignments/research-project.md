The major assignment for this course is a research project in which you find or create a dataset that allows you to investigate a historical topic. You will then use Python to process and analyze the data in order to present an argument, interpretation, or narrative based on that analysis. You are free to choose any topic or dataset that you want, but it must be generally historical in nature. The assignment is scaffolded across several stages.

#### Research Project Proposal

Submit a research proposal to Canvas that addresses the following:

- Name
- Title of your project
- What research topic are you interested in?
- Description of Dataset: What kind of information does it contain? Are you going to be transcribing it yourself or is it already in a machine-readable format? How are you going to access it?
- Ideas for analysis: what research questions do you want to answer and how can you use this data to answer them?

_Final Project Proposal Due Sunday, April 20th by 11:59PM_

#### Draft & Presentation of Research Project

Your full research project will take the form of a Jupyter Notebook containing written analysis and code, all rendered on a page or set of pages on your portfolio website (we will be going over instructions on how to do this). You should address:

- **Introduction**: the questions you sought to answer about your data and any context that you think your reader will need to understand the data, including existing scholarship or research on the topic
- **Methodological** discussion of how the data was collected, processed, and analyzed
- **Main analysis** of the dataset: a clearly communicated argument, interpretation, or narrative supported by compelling evidence and examples; appropriate visualizations of your dataset
- **Conclusion**: the larger cultural context of this dataset; ethical concerns or issues around its collection or application
- **Bibliography**: list of existing scholarship and sources of your data

You will also give a presentation to your classmates during the last week of the semeseter that walks through your dataset and main analysis. Treat this as both an opportunity to share what you've accomplished and a chance to solicit feedback on specific pieces of your project.

_Due Tuesdsay, May 6th by the beginning of class_

#### Final Verison of Research Project

This will take the same format as the draft outlined above. Note that I will be assessing your final version of the project not just on its quality, but also on how well you took into account feedback from your peers and myself.
