The major assignment for this course is a research project in which you find or create a dataset that allows you to investigate some sort of historical topic. You will then use Python to process and analyze the data in order to present an argument, interpretation, or narrative based on that analysis. You are free to choose any topic or dataset that you want, but it must be historical in nature (broadly defined). (See [this example](https://cblevins.github.io/f21-data/final-projects/richards.html) of a former student's project.) The assignment is scaffolded across several steps.

## Research Project Proposal

Submit a research proposal over Canvas that addresses the following questions.

- Name
- Title of your project
- What research topic are you interested in?
- Description of Dataset: What kind of information does it contain? Are you going to be transcribing it yourself or is it already in a machine-readable format? How are you going to access it?
- Ideas for analysis: What research questions do you want to answer and how can you use this data to answer them?

Note: if you need ideas for where to find a dataset, take a look at [this guide]({{ "/modules/finding-datasets" | relative_url }}) to get started.

## Research Project Draft

Your full research project will take the form of a Jupyter Notebook containing written analysis and code, all rendered on a page or set of pages on your portfolio website (we will be going over instructions on how to do this). You should address:

- **Introduction** of the questions you sought to answer about your data and any context that you think your reader will need to understand the data, including existing scholarship or research on the topic
- **Methodological** discussion of how the data was collected, processed, and analyzed
- **Main analysis** of the dataset: a clearly communicated argument, interpretation, or narrative supported by compelling evidence and examples; appropriate visualizations of your dataset
- **Conclusion**: the larger cultural context of this dataset; ethical concerns or issues around its collection or application
- **Bibliography**: list of existing scholarship along with sources of your data

## Presentation of Research Project Draft

During the last week of the semester you will give a **5-minute presentation** to your classmates that walks through your dataset and major analytical findings. Treat this as both an opportunity to share what you've accomplished and a chance to solicit feedback on specific pieces of your project. Do NOT try to cover everything about your project. Instead, focus on giving a high-level introduction followed by a few examples or areas of the project that you would like feedback on.

## Peer Review of Research Project Draft

You will be assigned one of your classmates' projects to review in more depth. As part of the review, you will read their project analysis and provide qualitative feedback over Canvas.

## Research Project (Final)

This will take the same format as the draft outlined above. Note that I will be assessing your final version of the project not only on its overall quality, but also on the quality of your revisions and how well you took into account feedback from your peers and myself.
