<p>As a group, let’s try and hammer out a few of the questions that you’ll be answering for your <a href="/sp25-data/assignments/data-biography">Data Biography</a> of a separate dataset. Go to <a href="https://slavevoyages.org/">https://slavevoyages.org/</a> and try to figure out answers to the following questions about the dataset:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Where</strong> did it come from?</li>
  <li><strong>Who</strong> collected, processed, and made it available?</li>
  <li><strong>How</strong> was it collected, processed, and made available?</li>
  <li><strong>Why</strong> was it collected, processed, and made available?</li>
  <li><strong>How</strong> is it stored today? How did you access it?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="step-2-exploring-the-database">Step 2: Exploring the Database</h3>

<p>Spend some time exploring the database itself (<a href="https://slavevoyages.org/voyage/database">https://slavevoyages.org/voyage/database</a>). See if you can use its functions to answer the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which nation sailed the most voyages in the 18th century?</li>
  <li>In which year did the largest number of enslaved people arrive in Barbados?</li>
  <li>In what sub-region in Africa were the most enslaved people purchased?</li>
</ul>
