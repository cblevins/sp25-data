## RESEARCH PROJECTS

<small>_During the final weeks of the semester you will be working on your research project. I have set aside time in class for project workshops, and will assign readings, tutorials, etc. depending on the needs of the class._</small>

## Week 13

### Tu. 4/22: Project Workshop

<!--
- ["Sort and Filter Data"](https://handsondataviz.org/sort.html) and ["Calculate with Formulas"](https://handsondataviz.org/calculate.html) from Chapter 2: Strengthen your Spreadsheet Skills in Jack Dougherty and Ilya Ilyankou, _Hands-On Data Visualization_. (Optional lesson: ["Match Columns with VLOOKUP"](https://handsondataviz.org/vlookup.html#vlookup))

- Before you start this lesson:
  - Create a new working directory in `working-with-data` called `python-humanities-lessons` and create a new Jupyter Notebook in this folder called `02-index-slice-subset.ipynb`. Use this notebook to go through this lesson.
  - Download and extract/unzip the zipped folder `data` distributed on Slack that contains the data files for this lesson, making sure the unzipped folder is in your working directory `python-humanities` for this lesson.
  - Read the two short sections ["Alex's Processing"](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-humanities-lesson/01-starting-with-data/index.html#:~:text=our%20focus%20today.-,alex%E2%80%99s%20processing,-Alex%20is%20a) and ["Our Data"](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-humanities-lesson/01-starting-with-data/index.html#:~:text=Our%20Data,For%20this%20lesson) to get an introduction to the data you'll be using.
