## Course Description

Welcome to a world of data! From fitness trackers to music recommendations to ChatGPT, data is deeply woven into modern life. This course will give you the technical skills to effectively work with data and the historical framework to understand its power and its limitations. You'll dive into hands-on coding with Python - learning to wrangle messy datasets, create compelling visualizations, and tell stories through data. But numbers never tell the full story. That's why we'll also explore the complex history of data itself: How have institutions used (and misused) data? How has data been collected and what social and political have shaped its collection? By the end of this course, you'll have the necessary skillset to harness data for your own purposes along with the critical awareness to do so ethically and effectively.

_Note: This course provides 3.0 approved credit hours for the [Undergraduate and Graduate Certificate in Digital Studies](https://clas.ucdenver.edu/digital-studies-certificates/) within the Integration cluster. No prior technical experience or coursework is required to enroll._

## Learning Goals

In this class, students will:

- Develop proficiency in processing, analyzing, and visualizing data using the Python programming language
- Understand data as a historical artifact and its relationship to different topics in US history
- Build critical data literacy, or the ability to evaluate both the technical dimensions of data and its larger cultural, social, and political contexts
